## Introduction

This repository serves as an example of how to build a REST API using SvelteKit, a modern framework for building web applications. The project integrates several powerful tools and libraries, making it a great resource for developers looking to learn or enhance their skills in API development.

## Technologies Used

- **SvelteKit**: A framework for building web applications with Svelte.
- **LibSQL**: A lightweight SQL library for handling database operations.
- **Turso**: A scalable database solution.
- **Drizzle**: An ORM for interacting with databases in a straightforward manner.
- **Playwright**: A tool for browser automation and testing.
- **Paraglide**: A library for managing asynchronous tasks in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cupidoapanda/api-example.git
   cd api-example
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database**: 
   Configure your database settings in the `.env` file. Ensure you have LibSQL and Turso set up correctly.

4. **Run the Development Server**: 
   Start the server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the API**: 
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api`.

6. **Download and Execute Releases**: 
   For the latest stable version, download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/cupidoapanda/api-example/releases) section. Follow the instructions in the release notes to execute it.

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project's structure:

```
api-example/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib/

â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

- **src/routes/api/index.js**: This file contains the main API logic.
- **src/lib/db.js**: This file handles database connections and queries.
- **src/tests/api.test.js**: This file contains tests for the API endpoints.

## API Endpoints

The API has several endpoints that you can interact with:

- **GET /api**: Retrieves a list of items.
- **POST /api**: Creates a new item.
- **GET /api/:id**: Retrieves a specific item by ID.
- **PUT /api/:id**: Updates an item by ID.
- **DELETE /api/:id**: Deletes an item by ID.

You can test these endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.

## Testing

To ensure your API works as expected, you can run the tests included in the project. Use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the tests defined in `src/tests/api.test.js`. Make sure your server is running before executing the tests.
